This repository tracks our first impact with the
[Plonky2](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2) proving system.

A lot of what is written here is heavily inspired to the
[example code](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/tree/main/plonky2/examples)
provided in Plonky2's repository.

The goal is to be able to write a circuit that allows one to prove
the knowledge of a solution to a given sudoku problem.
